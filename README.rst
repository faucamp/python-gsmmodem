python-gsmmodem 
===============
*GSM modem module for Python*

python-gsmmodem is a module that allows easy control of a GSM modem attached
to the system. It also includes a couple of useful commandline utilities for
interacting with a GSM modem. 

Its features include:

- simple methods for sending SMS messages, checking signal level, etc
- easy-to-use API for starting and responding to USSD sessions and making voice
  calls
- handling incoming phone calls and received SMS messages via callback methods
- support for SMS PDU and text mode
- support for tracking SMS status reports
- wraps AT command errors into Python exceptions by default
- modular design; you easily issue your own AT commands to the modem (with
  error  checking), or read/write directly from/to the modem if you prefer
- comprehensive test suite

Bundled utilities:

- **GSMTerm**: an easy-to-use serial terminal for communicating with an
  attached GSM modem. It features command completion, built-in help for many AT
  commands, history, context-aware prompt, etc.
- **sendsms.py**: a simple command line script to send SMS messages
- **identify-modem.py**: simple utility to identify attached modem. Can also be
  used to provide debug information used for development of python-gsmmodem. 

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.6 or later

How to install this package
---------------------------

There are two ways to install ``python-gsmmodem``:

Automatic installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_ will automatically download and install
all dependencies, as required. You can also utilise ``easy_install`` in the
same manner as using ``pip`` above.  

If you are utilising ``python-gsmmodem`` as part of another project,
add it to your ``install_requires`` section of your ``setup.py`` file and
upon your project's installation, it will be pulled in automatically.

Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and extract the ``python-gsmmodem`` archive from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gsmmodem>`_ for the current release
version, or clone from `GitHub <https://github.com/faucamp/python-gsmmodem>`_.
Next, do this::

    python setup.py install

Note that ``python-gsmmodem`` relies on ``pyserial`` for serial communications:
